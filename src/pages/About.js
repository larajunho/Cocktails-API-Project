				We are here to bring you information about different cocktails. A cocktail is an alcoholic mixed drink.
				Most commonly, cocktails are either a combination of spirits, or one or more spirits mixed with other
				ingredients such as tonic water, fruit juice, flavored syrup, or cream. Cocktails vary widely across
				regions of the world, and many websites publish both original recipes and their own interpretations of
				older and more famous cocktails. The origins of the word cocktail have been debated. The first written
				mention of cocktail as a beverage appeared in The Farmers Cabinet, 1803 in the United States. The first
				definition of a cocktail as an alcoholic beverage appeared three years later in The Balance and
				Columbian Repository (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806. Traditionally, cocktail ingredients included
				spirits, sugar, water and bitters, however, this definition evolved throughout the 1800s, to include the
				addition of a liqueur.
